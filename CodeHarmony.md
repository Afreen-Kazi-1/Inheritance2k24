## 🔮Future Scope
**Multi-Instrumental Handling:** You can extend DDSP’s capabilities to handle multiple instruments by training models to recognize more complex polyphonic audio.
**Customizable Features:** Allow users to tweak parameters like pitch, tone, or tempo before converting.
**More Instrument Options:** As you expand your project, you can fine-tune more DDSP models for different instruments (e.g., Sitar, drums, etc.).
**Real-Time Progress Tracking:** Users can monitor the status of their song conversion, with updates on when the file is being processed and ready for download.

## 💸Applications
