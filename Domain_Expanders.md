## 📝Description
* Creative writing can be challenging, whether for inspiration, entertainment, or artistic expression. Writers often struggle with writer’s block, lack of ideas, or difficulty maintaining a consistent tone and style. This project aims to solve this problem by using AI to generate stories and poems based on user preferences.
* This Web Application along with AI-integration will allow users to generate engaging stories and poems effortlessly. By selecting a theme (e.g., thriller, romance, horror, adventure, humor) and optionally providing a prompt, users can guide the generation process. If no prompt is given, the model creates a random story or poem in the chosen genre. A word limit option ensures customizable output length.
